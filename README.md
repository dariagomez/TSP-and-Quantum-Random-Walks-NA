Hi, be sure you download NA_adjacency2.csv so you can run Quantum Random Walks with your own address. The example programms are for Jalisco State (number 30). I ran the propabilites to get to one point to another in the graph, using Jalisco as starting point, they aren't zero because we are considering quantum distribution.
